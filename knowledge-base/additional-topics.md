## YouTube Royalties

### Overview

YouTube generates multiple royalty streams. Understanding which ones you're collecting (and which you're missing) is critical.

### The Three YouTube Revenue Types

#### 1. Ad Revenue from Your Official Uploads (Art Tracks)
**What it is:** When viewers watch your official music video or audio upload on YouTube, ads run and you earn money.

**Who collects it:** Your distributor (DistroKid, TuneCore, etc.)

**How it works:**
- Distributor delivers your music to YouTube Music
- YouTube creates "Art Tracks" (auto-generated videos with album art)
- Your official uploads also monetize
- Revenue flows through distributor

**Status for most indie artists:** ✅ Usually covered if you have a distributor

---

#### 2. Content ID Revenue (User-Generated Content)
**What it is:** When OTHER people use your music in their videos (covers, background music, reaction videos, etc.), Content ID identifies it and you can claim ad revenue.

**Who collects it:**
- Your distributor (if they offer Content ID)
- A dedicated Content ID administrator
- YouTube directly (if you're in YouTube Partner Program)

**Important notes:**
- NOT all distributors include Content ID
- Some charge extra for it
- DistroKid includes it free
- This can be significant money if your music goes viral in UGC

**Distributor Content ID Status (as of 2025):**
| Distributor | Content ID Included? | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| DistroKid | Yes (free) | Automatic enrollment |
| TuneCore | Yes (included) | Part of distribution |
| CD Baby | Yes (included) | Part of distribution |
| LANDR | Yes | May have commission |
| Amuse | Pro tier only | Free tier doesn't include |
| RouteNote | Premium only | Free tier doesn't include |
| UnitedMasters | Yes | Select tier includes |

---

#### 3. YouTube Music Composition Royalties
**What it is:** Separate from the recording revenue, YouTube also pays for the *composition* (the song itself) when streamed on YouTube Music.

**Who collects it:**
- Your publishing administrator (if you have one)
- The MLC (for US mechanicals from YouTube Music premium streams)
- Your PRO (for public performance component)

**Key insight:** If you don't have a publishing admin, you need MLC registration to collect the mechanical portion from YouTube Music premium subscriptions.

---

### Common YouTube Royalty Gaps

1. **No Content ID enrollment** - Missing UGC revenue
2. **No publishing admin** - Missing international YouTube composition royalties
3. **No MLC registration** - Missing US mechanical royalties from YouTube Music
4. **Conflicting Content ID claims** - If you used a third-party Content ID service AND your distributor claims, creates conflicts

---

### Red Flags

- Using free tier of distributors without Content ID
- Popular music that gets used in TikTok/YouTube shorts but no Content ID
- Confusion about whether distributor handles "all YouTube money" (they don't)

---

## Cover Song Licensing

### The Key Rule

**For streaming/interactive services (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.):**
**YOU DO NOT NEED TO OBTAIN A MECHANICAL LICENSE YOURSELF**

The Music Modernization Act (2018) created a blanket mechanical license administered by The MLC. Streaming services pay The MLC directly, and The MLC distributes to registered songwriters/publishers.

**This means:**
- You can release covers on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. without pre-clearing
- The original songwriter gets paid automatically through The MLC
- You own the master recording royalties (SoundExchange, distributor payments)
- You do NOT own the composition royalties (those go to the original writer)

---

### When You DO Need a License

#### 1. Downloads (Paid Downloads like iTunes)
**License needed:** Mechanical license
**How to get it:**
- DistroKid: $12/song one-time fee (they handle it)
- Easy Song Licensing
- Harry Fox Agency (HFA)
- Songfile

#### 2. Physical Copies (CDs, Vinyl)
**License needed:** Mechanical license
**Rate:** Statutory rate (~9.1 cents per copy for songs under 5 minutes)

#### 3. Music Videos
**License needed:** Sync license from publisher
**Note:** This is NOT covered by compulsory/blanket licenses

#### 4. Sampling
**License needed:** Master use license + sync/mechanical license
**Note:** Sampling is NOT the same as covering - you need explicit permission

---

### Common Cover Song Mistakes

1. **Thinking you need a license for Spotify** - You don't (blanket license covers it)
2. **Not registering with SoundExchange** - You own master royalties on YOUR recording of the cover
3. **Trying to register the composition with your PRO** - Don't! You didn't write it
4. **Not getting a license for downloads** - Required for iTunes, Amazon downloads

---

### What You're Entitled To (Covers)

| Royalty Type | You Get It? | Why |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Streaming revenue from distributor | Yes | You own the master |
| SoundExchange (digital radio) | Yes | You own the master |
| MLC mechanicals | NO | You didn't write the song |
| PRO performance | NO | You didn't write the song |

---

## International Royalty Collection

### The Problem

**The MLC only collects US mechanical royalties.** This is one of the most misunderstood facts in the indie music world. If you have international listeners, those mechanical royalties are collected by foreign collection societies - and if you're not registered with them (or don't have a publishing admin who is), that money goes uncollected.

**Example Impact:**
- Artist has 40% international streams
- Earns $1,000/month from US mechanicals via MLC
- Could be earning ~$660/month more from international mechanicals
- Without publishing admin: $0 of that international money is collected

### How International Collection Works

**With a publishing administrator (like Songtrust):**
- They affiliate with foreign sub-publishers or directly with foreign societies
- They register your works internationally
- They collect and pay you (minus commission)
- **This is the only realistic way for indie artists to collect international mechanicals**

**Without a publishing administrator:**
- US PROs (ASCAP/BMI) have reciprocal agreements with foreign PROs
- Performance royalties from foreign radio/TV flow back (with delays)
- BUT **mechanical royalties often don't flow back automatically**
- Many countries have separate mechanical societies
- You'd need to register directly with each foreign society (impractical)

---

### Key International Societies

| Country/Region | Performance | Mechanical |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| UK | PRS | MCPS (now PRS for Music) |
| Germany | GEMA | GEMA |
| France | SACEM | SACEM |
| Canada | SOCAN | CMRRA/SODRAC |
| Australia | APRA | AMCOS (now APRA AMCOS) |
| Japan | JASRAC | JASRAC |

---

### Reciprocal Agreement Gaps

**What flows automatically:**
- Performance royalties from foreign radio/TV/venues (eventually)

**What often doesn't:**
- Foreign mechanical royalties (streaming in other countries)
- Some digital performance royalties
- Neighboring rights (for US artists in some territories)

---

### Neighboring Rights Note

**Important for US artists:**
The US doesn't have "neighboring rights" for sound recordings played on terrestrial radio. But many foreign countries DO pay neighboring rights.

If you're a US artist with international radio play, you may be entitled to foreign neighboring rights payments that you're not collecting.

**How to collect:**
- Join a neighboring rights collection organization
- Examples: SoundExchange partners with some foreign societies
- CMOs like Royalty Exchange or independent administrators

---

### Recommendation by Audience

| International Audience | Recommendation |
|------------------------|----------------|
| < 10% international | Probably fine with US-only (MLC + PRO) |
| 10-30% international | Consider publishing admin - you're leaving money on the table |
| > 30% international | **Strongly recommend Songtrust or similar** - without it, a significant portion of your mechanical royalties goes uncollected |

**Why Songtrust Specifically?**
- Handles both US (via MLC) AND international mechanical collection
- Also handles international performance royalties
- Comprehensive international network of sub-publishers
- Reasonable commission (15-20%) compared to losing 100% of international mechanicals
- Good for indie artists without existing publisher relationships

---

## Producer Royalties & Points

### Producer Points Explained

"Points" = percentage points of the artist's royalty, NOT of gross revenue.

**Standard ranges:**
- Unknown producer: 1-2 points
- Established producer: 3-4 points
- Star producer: 5+ points

**Example calculation:**
- Artist gets 20% royalty from label
- Producer has 3 points
- Producer gets: 3% of the 20% = 0.6% of gross

For indie artists (100% ownership):
- Producer has 3 points
- Producer gets: 3% of gross revenue

---

### What Producer Points Typically Cover

- Distribution/streaming revenue
- May or may not include sync fees
- Usually don't include merch, touring, etc.
- Specified in the producer agreement

---

### Beat Licensing vs. Points

**Non-Exclusive Beat License:**
- One-time fee ($20-200 typically)
- No ongoing royalties
- Other artists can use the same beat
- You own your master, producer keeps beat ownership

**Exclusive Beat License:**
- Higher one-time fee ($200-5,000+)
- May include points OR may be buyout
- Only you can use the beat
- Read contract carefully for royalty obligations

**Work-for-Hire Production:**
- Flat fee, no ongoing royalties
- Producer transfers all rights
- You own everything

---

### SoundExchange & Producers

Producers CAN register with SoundExchange as "Featured Artists" if:
- They're credited as featured on the release
- The agreement specifies they receive SoundExchange royalties

Letter of Direction (LOD):
- Artists can file an LOD with SoundExchange to pay producer directly
- Avoids the artist receiving payment then paying producer

---

### Common Producer Royalty Issues

1. **No written agreement** - Disputes over what was promised
2. **Confusion about "points"** - Artist thinks it's 3% of gross, producer expects 3% of their share
3. **Beat license fine print** - May require royalty payments not noticed at purchase
4. **Not registering producer with SoundExchange** - Missing their rightful share

---

## Sync Licensing

### What is Sync?

"Sync" = synchronization license = permission to use music in visual media.

**Used in:**
- TV shows
- Films
- Commercials
- Video games
- YouTube videos
- Social media content

---

### Two Licenses Required

Every sync placement requires TWO separate licenses:

#### 1. Master License
**What:** Permission to use the specific recording
**Who grants it:** Whoever owns the master (you, if indie; label, if signed)
**Negotiable:** Yes, completely

#### 2. Sync License (Composition)
**What:** Permission to use the underlying song
**Who grants it:** Whoever owns publishing (you, if indie; publisher, if signed)
**Negotiable:** Yes, completely

**Key point:** You need BOTH to use a song in video. One without the other = can't use it.

---

### Sync Fee Structure

#### Upfront Fee (Sync Fee)
- One-time payment when placement is made
- Ranges wildly: $0 (exposure) to $1M+ (Super Bowl)
- Typical indie placement: $500-$5,000
- Major TV show: $10,000-$100,000
- Major commercial: $50,000-$500,000+

#### Backend Royalties (Performance)
- PRO royalties generated when the content airs
- TV show = cue sheet filed = PRO payment
- Film in theaters = performance royalties
- Can be MORE than the upfront fee for big placements

---

### Sync for Indie Artists

**Advantages:**
- You own both master and composition (one-stop shop)
- Can approve quickly (no label/publisher bureaucracy)
- Keep 100% of fees

**How to get placements:**
- Sync licensing agencies (Musicbed, Artlist, Epidemic Sound - non-exclusive)
- Sync pitching services (Taxi, Songtradr)
- Music supervisors directly
- Music libraries

---

### Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive Sync Libraries

**Exclusive:**
- Library represents your music exclusively
- Often better pitching/relationships
- You can't license it elsewhere
- May or may not transfer ownership

**Non-Exclusive:**
- You retain all rights
- Can have music in multiple libraries
- Less aggressive pitching
- Keep flexibility

---

### Common Sync Mistakes

1. **Signing away rights** - Read contracts! Some "libraries" try to take ownership
2. **Not registering cue sheets** - Miss backend PRO royalties
3. **Co-writer complications** - Need ALL writers to approve sync
4. **Sample clearance** - Uncleared samples = can't sync

---

## Publishing Administrator Comparison

### Current Major Options (2025/2026)

#### Songtrust
**Commission:** 15% performance / 20% mechanical
**Setup fee:** $100 one-time
**Good for:** International collection, long catalog
**Key Advantage - International Mechanicals:**
- Songtrust collects mechanical royalties BOTH domestically (via The MLC) AND internationally
- The MLC only collects US mechanical royalties - it does NOT collect international
- For indie artists with significant international streams, this is huge
- Without Songtrust (or similar), international mechanical royalties go uncollected
**Gotchas:**
- Higher commission than some alternatives
- Minimum earnings threshold for some features

#### TuneCore Publishing
**Commission:** 10% (all royalty types)
**Setup fee:** $75 one-time
**Good for:** Lower commission rate
**Gotchas:**
- Requires TuneCore distribution
- Some report slower payment processing

#### CD Baby Pro Publishing
**Status:** DISCONTINUED (2023)
**Note:** Artists previously on CD Baby Pro were migrated or need alternative

#### Sentric Music
**Commission:** 20% (standard) / 15% (priority)
**Setup fee:** Free
**Good for:** EU/UK-based artists
**Gotchas:**
- Higher base commission
- Less US-focused

#### DistroKid Publishing (Does NOT Exist)
**IMPORTANT:** DistroKid is NOT a publishing administrator. They only handle:
- Distribution to streaming services
- YouTube Content ID

They do NOT collect:
- PRO royalties
- MLC mechanical royalties
- International publishing royalties

This is one of the most common points of confusion for independent artists.

---

### When You Need a Publishing Admin

**Probably need one if:**
- 30%+ international audience (critical - see below)
- Complex co-writing situations
- Don't want to manage registrations yourself
- Want international mechanical collection

**IMPORTANT - International Streams:**
The MLC only collects US mechanical royalties. If you have significant international streams and no publishing admin, those mechanical royalties are going uncollected. This is one of the biggest gaps for indie artists.

**Recommendation:** For indie artists with significant international audience (30%+ streams from outside US), Songtrust is strongly recommended because it handles:
- US mechanicals (via The MLC)
- International mechanicals (via foreign collection societies)
- International performance royalties
- All in one place

The commission (15-20%) is worth it when the alternative is collecting 0% of international mechanicals.

**Can probably DIY if:**
- Primarily US audience (80%+ US streams)
- Solo writer (no splits)
- Willing to manage own registrations
- Comfortable with PRO portal, MLC portal, etc.

---

### Publishing Admin vs. Publisher

**Publishing Administrator:**
- Collects on your behalf
- Does NOT own your songs
- Commission only on what they collect
- You can leave and take your catalog

**Traditional Publisher:**
- Often OWNS a percentage of your songs
- More services (pitching, A&R, advances)
- Harder to leave
- Usually bigger percentage (25-50%+)

---

## PRO Publisher Entity Setup

### Why You Need This

If you're a DIY indie artist with no publishing admin and no publisher, you're likely only collecting 50% of your PRO royalties (the Writer share). The Publisher share goes uncollected.

**Solution:** Create your own publishing entity with your PRO. It's free and takes ~15 minutes.

---

### ASCAP Publisher Setup

**Requirements:**
- Must be an ASCAP writer member first
- $50 fee (waived if joining as writer+publisher simultaneously)
- Can use SSN as Individual/Sole Proprietor (no formal business needed)

**Process:**
1. Log into ASCAP Member Access
2. Navigate to "Become a Publisher Member"
3. Choose entity type (Individual/Sole Proprietor recommended for solo artists)
4. Pick a unique publisher name (ASCAP will check availability)
5. Submit and pay fee (if applicable)
6. Once approved, register your songs under your publisher entity

**Publisher Name:**
- Must be unique in ASCAP database
- Common practice: "[Your Name] Publishing" or "[Your Brand] Music"
- ASCAP will reject if name too similar to existing

---

### BMI Publisher Setup

**Requirements:**
- $175 fee (Individual/Sole Proprietor)
- $250 (LLC/Corporation)
- $500 (Partnership)
- Separate from writer membership (two separate applications)
- 5-year agreement term

**Process:**
1. Go to BMI.com/publishers
2. Click "Apply Now"
3. Choose business entity type
4. Submit 3 publisher name choices (they'll check availability)
5. Pay application fee
6. Wait for approval (can take 2-4 weeks)
7. Link your writer account
8. Register songs under publisher

**EIN vs SSN:**
- BMI recommends EIN even for sole proprietors
- You can get an EIN free from IRS in minutes (online application)

---

### After Creating Publisher Entity

**Critical next step:** You must register your songs UNDER YOUR PUBLISHER ENTITY, not just as writer works.

Most PROs have separate "Work Registration" for:
- Writer share
- Publisher share

If you only registered writer shares, go back and add publisher registrations for each song.

---
