## 1. Double Publishing Admin

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical

**TRIGGER:**
- Current publishing admin = yes AND
- Previous publishing admin = yes AND
- Previous not confirmed cancelled

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Both admins register same songs with PROs
- Conflicting ownership claims
- Royalties frozen until resolved
- Possibly paying double commission

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Flag as complex
- DO NOT tell them to register anything new
- Recommend done-for-you to untangle
- Warning: "You may have conflicting registrations that need resolution before proceeding"

---

## 2. PRO Member + Publishing Admin Overlap

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- PRO member = yes AND
- Registered works themselves = yes AND
- Publishing admin = yes

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Admin may have re-registered same works
- Duplicate registrations in PRO database
- Possible payment splits/confusion

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Ask: "Did you register works before or after signing with your publishing admin?"
- Note: May need to verify no duplicates exist
- If admin came after: "Your admin may have created duplicate registrations. Verify in your PRO portal."

---

## 3. Co-Writers with Unconfirmed Splits

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Has co-writers = yes AND
- Split sheets signed = no or some

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- If splits registered differently by each party, royalties freeze
- Total ownership > 100% = nothing pays out
- Disputes can take months to resolve

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Priority action: "Before registering, confirm splits with all co-writers in writing"
- Provide split sheet template link
- If many co-writes: recommend done-for-you

---

## 4. Co-Writer Already Registered (Potential Conflict)

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Has co-writers = yes AND
- Co-writer PRO registration status = "not sure" or "yes they registered"

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Co-writer may have registered with wrong splits
- Your registration + theirs = over 100%
- Frozen royalties

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Before registering, search Songview for your songs to see if they're already registered"
- "Contact co-writers to confirm what splits they registered"
- If conflict found: "Do not register until resolved"

---

## 5. DistroKid "Publishing" Confusion

**SEVERITY:** 🟢 Info

**TRIGGER:**
- Distributor = DistroKid AND
- Publishing admin = none or "DistroKid"

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Artist thinks DistroKid handles publishing
- Missing PRO, MLC, SoundExchange royalties entirely

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Educate: "DistroKid does NOT provide publishing administration. Their services are limited to distribution and YouTube monetization."
- "You need separate registration with PRO, MLC, and SoundExchange"

---

## 6. No MLC Registration (Post-2021 Releases)

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical (if no publishing admin)

**TRIGGER:**
- MLC registered = no AND
- Publishing admin = none AND
- Releasing music since 2021

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Missing ~15% of streaming income
- Royalties accumulating in MLC unmatched pool
- May be redistributed to others after 3 years

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Priority 1: "Register with The MLC immediately"
- Estimate lost royalties
- Note urgency: "Unclaimed royalties may be redistributed"

---

## 7. No SoundExchange Registration

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical (if getting radio play) / 🟡 Warning (if not)

**TRIGGER:**
- SoundExchange = no AND
- Has released recordings

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Missing digital radio royalties (Pandora, SiriusXM, etc.)
- SiriusXM pays ~$35 per spin total (split between Rights Owner and Featured Artist)
- Amount varies significantly by genre/exposure
- This is the MOST valuable royalty if getting SXM play

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:**
SoundExchange has TWO separate registrations:
1. **Rights Owner** - Who owns the master recording
2. **Featured Artist** - Who is the main performer on the recording

Most indie artists need BOTH registrations to collect 100%.

Also critical: You're entitled to these royalties even on COVER SONGS. If you recorded and performed a cover of someone else's song, you own the Rights Owner and Featured Artist royalties for YOUR recording (not the underlying composition royalties - those go to the songwriter).

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Register with SoundExchange as BOTH Rights Owner AND Featured Artist"
- "Even if you've registered once, verify you're registered on both sides"
- "This applies to cover songs too - you own the master royalties for your recordings"
- Note: "SXM spins are extremely valuable (~$35/spin total at 100% ownership)"

---

## 7b. SoundExchange - Only Registered One Side

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- SoundExchange = yes AND
- Only registered as one type (Rights Owner OR Featured Artist, not both)

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Only collecting 50% of what you're owed
- The other 50% sits uncollected
- If getting SXM play, this is significant money

**DETECTION:**
- Ask follow-up: "Did you register as Rights Owner, Featured Artist, or both?"

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "You're only collecting half your SoundExchange royalties"
- "Log in and register as [the missing side] to collect the other half"
- "This could double your SoundExchange income"

---

## 8. Multiple Artist Names

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Changed artist names = yes AND
- Previous names count > 1

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Registrations fragmented across names
- Some songs may be registered under old name only
- Searches may miss catalog

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Search all royalty databases under each name variation"
- "Verify registrations exist for songs under each name"
- If 3+ names: recommend done-for-you

---

## 9. Old/Dissolved Publishing Entity

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Previous publishing admin = yes AND
- Status = "company may not exist anymore" or "not sure if active"

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Old entity may still be listed as admin on songs
- Royalties may be going to defunct entity
- Rights may need to be formally reclaimed

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Verify current publisher listing on your PRO account"
- "If old entity still listed, you may need to file for reversion"
- Complex situation: recommend done-for-you

---

## 10. Songs Recorded by Other Artists (Unregistered)

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Songs by other artists = yes AND
- Registered as songwriter on those = "no" or "not sure"

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Those songs generate royalties you're not collecting
- Other artist's team may not have registered you correctly
- Could be significant money especially if their releases are bigger

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Identify all songs recorded by other artists"
- "Verify you're registered as songwriter on each"
- "Contact those artists/their teams to confirm"

---

## 11. Estate/Inherited Catalog

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical

**TRIGGER:**
- Inherited catalog = yes OR
- Managing for deceased person = yes

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Legal authority required before any changes
- Accounts may need estate transfer
- Complex ownership situations

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Route to consultation immediately
- "Estate situations require legal documentation before proceeding"
- DO NOT provide DIY registration steps

---

## 12. Legal Disputes Mentioned

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical

**TRIGGER:**
- Any mention of disputes, lawsuits, contested ownership

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Registering could complicate legal situation
- Need legal guidance first

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Route to consultation
- "Legal disputes require attorney guidance before making any registrations"
- DO NOT provide registration steps

---

## 13. High Income Without Professional Setup

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Monthly income > $3,000 AND
- Missing 2+ major registrations (PRO, MLC, SoundExchange)

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Significant money being lost
- Higher stakes = worth professional help

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Emphasize urgency and amounts
- Strong recommendation for done-for-you
- "At your income level, missing registrations could mean $X,XXX+ lost annually"

---

## 14. Very New Artist (Setup Guidance)

**SEVERITY:** 🟢 Info

**TRIGGER:**
- Releasing music < 6 months AND
- Songs released < 5 AND
- Income < $100/month

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Not really a "gotcha" - just needs basic setup
- Low complexity, low stakes

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Provide straightforward setup checklist
- Emphasize "get this right from the start"
- DIY probably fine

---

## 15. International Focus Without Global Collection

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Significant audience outside US indicated AND
- Publishing admin = none AND
- Only registered with US entities

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Missing international mechanical royalties
- Missing international performance royalties
- MLC only covers US

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "The MLC only collects US royalties. For international collection, you need a publishing administrator or direct foreign society registration"
- Recommend Songtrust/Sentric for simplicity

---

## 16. PRO - Only Registered as Writer (Missing Publisher Share)

**SEVERITY:** 🔴 Critical

**TRIGGER:**
- PRO member = yes AND
- Publishing admin = none AND
- Has NOT created own publishing entity with PRO

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:**
Performance royalties are split 50/50 between **Writer** and **Publisher**. This is true at ASCAP, BMI, and all PROs.

- If you're signed to a publisher, they collect the publisher 50%
- If you have a publishing admin (Songtrust, CD Baby Pro, etc.), they collect publisher share on your behalf
- If you're a DIY indie artist with NO publisher and NO admin, **you're only collecting 50% of your performance royalties**

The solution: Create your own publishing entity with your PRO. This is FREE and takes ~15 minutes. You're essentially becoming your own publisher to collect both halves.

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Missing 50% of all performance royalties
- This affects EVERY song, EVERY play
- At $100/month in writer royalties, you're missing another $100/month in publisher royalties
- Many artists don't realize this for years

**DETECTION:**
- Ask follow-up: "Have you set up a publishing entity with your PRO, or are you only registered as a writer?"
- Most will say "What's a publishing entity?" = they're missing it

**PLAN ACTION:**
- Priority 1: "Set up a publishing entity with your PRO immediately"
- "This is FREE and takes about 15 minutes"
- "You could be missing 50% of your performance royalties"
- "At ASCAP: Go to Member Access → Create a Publisher. At BMI: Apply for publisher affiliation."
- "Once created, you need to register your songs under your publisher entity too"
- Estimate: Double their current PRO estimate

---

## 17. Missing YouTube Content ID

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Using free-tier distributor that doesn't include Content ID AND
- Has music that could be used in UGC (user-generated content)

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Missing revenue from other people using your music in their videos
- Can be significant if music goes viral in TikTok/YouTube shorts

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Verify your distributor includes YouTube Content ID"
- "If not, upgrade to a tier that includes it or use a separate Content ID administrator"
- List distributors with/without Content ID

---

## 18. Cover Song Download Licensing

**SEVERITY:** 🟢 Info

**TRIGGER:**
- Has released cover songs AND
- Cover songs available for download (iTunes, Amazon, etc.)

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:**
For streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music), you do NOT need a mechanical license - The MLC's blanket license covers it. However, for DOWNLOADS (paid downloads), you DO still need a mechanical license.

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- If releasing covers for download without license, potentially liable
- Most distributors now handle this automatically (DistroKid charges $12/song)

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "If you have cover songs on download platforms, verify mechanical licenses were obtained"
- "DistroKid and others handle this for a fee - check that it was included"
- "For streaming only, no action needed (blanket license covers it)"

---

## 19. Producer Points Undocumented

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Worked with outside producers AND
- No written agreement on royalty split

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- Disputes over what percentage producer is owed
- Confusion about whether points are from gross or artist share
- Potential legal issues if producer wasn't work-for-hire

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "Document producer agreements in writing"
- "Clarify whether producer has royalty points or was paid flat fee"
- "If producer has points, file Letter of Direction with SoundExchange"

---

## 20. CD Baby Pro Migration Gap

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Previously used CD Baby Pro Publishing AND
- Status unclear after 2023 discontinuation

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- CD Baby Pro Publishing was discontinued in 2023
- Artists may not have been properly migrated or set up alternative
- Could have gap in collection

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "CD Baby Pro Publishing was discontinued in 2023"
- "Verify your songs are registered somewhere for publishing collection"
- "May need to register with The MLC directly and/or get new publishing admin"

---

## 21. International Audience Without Publishing Admin

**SEVERITY:** 🟡 Warning

**TRIGGER:**
- Reports 30%+ of audience outside US AND
- No publishing administrator AND
- Only registered with US entities

**CONSEQUENCE:**
- The MLC only collects US mechanical royalties
- International mechanical royalties going uncollected
- Some foreign performance royalties may flow back via PRO, but with delays and gaps

**PLAN ACTION:**
- "With significant international audience, consider a publishing administrator"
- "The MLC only covers US royalties - international mechanicals need separate collection"
- "Songtrust, TuneCore Publishing, and others handle international registration"
